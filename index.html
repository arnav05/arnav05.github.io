                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Currently based in Toronto, Canada, I recently joined Rocscience as a full-time software developer. For over 25 years, Rocscience has been at the forefront of developing industry-leading solutions tailored specifically for civil, mining,
                    and geotechnical engineers. Prior to this, I completed two internships with the company, totaling eight transformative months of experience. </p>
                <p>I’m passionate about technology and I particularly excel in entrepreneurial environments, where I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional and dynamic teams to solve complex problems.</p>

                <p>
                    In our ever-evolving world of new technologies, coding languages, AI applications, and frameworks, I stay current by creating small side projects. This hands-on approach grants me a comprehensive understanding of the latest advancements. </p>

                    ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and art. Although I haven't invested in Gamestop or Bored Monkey NFTs, I firmly believe in the future potential of blockchain technology and its versatile applications. </p>

                    Kitchener-Waterloo and Huntsman Cancer Research. Previously, I was also involved in fundraising for CMHA (Canadian Mental Health Association) in 2020-21 and a charity for underprivileged children in India from 2014-18.

                <h5>Managed me directly at Rocscience</h5>
                <p>Few people can take an abstract assignment and just run with it and produce results. It was a pleasure working with Arnav during his 4-month internship at Rocscience as a software developer. I was the project manager of a new project and
                    worked directly with Arnav on the engine. I was impressed by Arnav's ability to employ outside-the-box thinking to various research and coding components of the computational modules in the engine. He delivered multiple alternatives
                    which were novel, adaptive, documented, and well-tested solutions. He always had a positive attitude toward his work, and colleagues, and was an overall great fit for the company culture. Any project manager would be lucky to have
                    Arnav on their team.</p>

                <h5>Managed me directly at Acerta</h5>
                <p>Arnav has an understanding of both the Technical and the Business sides of a company with which he was able to communicate the complex AI and Machine Learning concepts using simple business terms. He comes to work with a thirst for learning,
                    has a very positive attitude towards his work and has a growth mindset. He did not hesitate on contributing extra time to ensure great quality of work. Arnav is a pleasure to manage. We accomplished several of our key objectives and
                    goals for this term. Arnav had a take-charge perspective on projects. He’s a beast when it comes to playing in a team and works exceptionally well with others. He is always willing to take on new challenges and try new things. I observed
                    that Arnav was able to apply learnings throughout this term and noticed a measurable improvement in the time management and planning. He demonstrated an outstanding performance while at Acerta.</p>
